### Data Exploratory
  Performed Basic Exploratory Data Analysis on the data set to understand the structure of the data set, Identify patterns or relationships, Detect outliers or errors, and generate hypothesis for further analysis or modeling.
### Database
  The project started with creating of database named KMS_DB
  ```sql
CREATE DATABASE KMS_DB
```
## Case Scenario
### Scenario 1
  1. Product category with highest sales  
2. Top 3 and bottom 3 sales regions  
3. Total appliance sales in Ontario  
4. How to increase revenue from bottom 10 customers

9. Most profitable consumer customer  
10. Customers who returned items and their segment  
11. Did shipping methods(Express air and Delivery Truck) match the order priority?

## üß† Insight
### Case Scenario 1
1. Product category with the highest sale
```sql
SELECT TOP 1 Product_Category, SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales
FROM KMS_Inventory
GROUP BY Product_Category
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC
```
2. Top 3 and Buttom 3 sales region
* Top 3
 ```sql
 SELECT TOP 3 Region, SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales
FROM KMS_Inventory
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC
```
* Buttom 3
```sql
SELECT TOP 3 Region, SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales
FROM KMS_Inventory
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY Total_Sales ASC
```
3. Total appliance sales in Ontario
```sql
SELECT SUM(SALES) AS Total_Sales 
FROM KMS_Inventory
WHERE Product_Category = 'Appliances'
AND Region = 'Ontario'
```
4. How to Increase revenue from buttom 10 customers
```sql
SELECT TOP 10 Customer_Name, 
SUM(Sales) AS Lowest_Customer_Sales, 
SUM(Profit) AS Total_Profit,
SUM(Shipping_Cost) AS Total_Shipping_Cost,
COUNT(Order_ID) AS Total_Order
FROM KMS_Inventory
GROUP BY Customer_Name
ORDER BY Lowest_Customer_Sales ASC
```
5. Most Expensive Shipping method
```sql
SELECT TOP 1 Ship_Mode, SUM(Shipping_Cost) AS Highest_Shipping_Cost
FROM KMS_Inventory
GROUP BY Ship_Mode
ORDER BY Highest_Shipping_Cost DESC
```
### Case Scenario 2
6. Most Valuable customers with itens they bought 
```sql
-----STEP 1: GETING THE TOP 5 CUSTOMERS AND HOW MUCH THEY SPENT---
SELECT TOP 5 Customer_Name,
SUM(Sales) AS Highest_Spent,
COUNT(Order_ID) AS Total_Order
FROM KMS_Inventory
GROUP BY Customer_Name
ORDER BY Highest_Spent DESC

----STEP 2: USING SUBQUERRY TO JOIN THE TOP CUSTOMERS AND WHAT TEHY PURCHASED----
WITH Top_Customers AS
(SELECT TOP 5
Customer_Name,
SUM(Sales) AS Total_Spent
FROM KMS_Inventory ki
GROUP BY Customer_Name
ORDER BY Total_Spent DESC
)
SELECT ki.Customer_Name,
		ki.Product_Name,
COUNT(*) AS Purchase_Count,
SUM(ki.Sales) AS Total_Spent_On_Products
FROM KMS_Inventory ki
JOIN Top_Customers tc 
ON ki.Customer_Name = tc.Customer_Name
GROUP BY ki.Customer_Name, ki.Product_Name
ORDER BY Total_Spent_On_Products DESC
```
7. Small business with the highest sales
```sql
SELECT TOP 1 Customer_Name, SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales
FROM KMS_Inventory
WHERE Customer_Segment = 'Small Business'
GROUP BY Customer_Name
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC
```
8. Corporate customer with most orders (2009-2012)
```sql
SELECT TOP 1 Customer_Name, 
COUNT (Order_ID) AS Total_Orders
FROM KMS_Inventory
WHERE Customer_Segment = 'Corporate' AND 
Order_Date BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2012-01-01'
GROUP BY Customer_Name
ORDER BY Total_Orders DESC
```
9. Most profitable consumer customer
```sql
SELECT TOP 1 Customer_Name, SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales
FROM KMS_Inventory
WHERE Customer_Segment = 'Consumer'
GROUP BY Customer_Name
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC
```

10. Did shipping methods match the order priority
```sql
ALTER VIEW KMS_VIEW
AS
SELECT KMS_Inventory.Order_ID,
KMS_Inventory.Sales,
KMS_Inventory.Customer_Name,
KMS_Inventory.Customer_Segment,
KMS_Return_Order.[Status]
FROM KMS_Inventory
FULL OUTER JOIN KMS_Return_Order
ON KMS_Return_Order.Order_ID = KMS_Inventory.Order_ID

SELECT * FROM KMS_VIEW

SELECT DISTINCT Customer_Name, Customer_Segment [STATUS]
FROM KMS_VIEW
